# Handwritten_math_equation_detection_from_image

This is a learning project. The goal is to take images of handwritten equations and solve it. The equation can also be drawn by the user if wanted. The scope is it only processes quadratic equations. Hidden variable has to be x. For example

```
x^2-3x+2=0
```
The equation must contain x,y,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,+,- . Anything else wont work.
## Getting Started
The project is run on python. Installing jupyter is higly recommended. There are 5 main files to see. Each part is given and detail is given in the code. MNIST dataset is used for training digits and x,y characters. + and - is trained from images downloaded from kaggle.

### Prerequisites



```
jupyter
tensorflow
keras
PIL
numpy
opencv2
```



## Running the tests

Run part4 among the codes. The rest is for training dataset. Choose to draw or select image files of equations. Set the model path accordingly test4.h5 is the latest. Other than that it would work.
